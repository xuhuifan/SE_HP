# SE_HP

Implementation Code for **Hawkes Process with Stochastic Exogenous Effects for Continuous-Time Interaction Modelling**. 

SE_HP_PP.jl is the main code for Hawkes Process with Poisson Process distributed changepoints (Full SE-HP)

SE_HP_Fixed_changepoint.jl is the main code for Hawkes Process, with the changepoints fixed as the time points when node i initiates interactions to others.

SGMCMC_SE_HP.jl is the implementation code for Stochastic Gradient MCMC inference for SE-HP.
